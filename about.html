                <p>I became interested in web development the same way an artist views art. As a programmer, you get to design
                    and implement a piece of you the same way an artist brings a concoction to life. When I was a kid, I
                    always thought I wanted to be an inventor of some sort and after I had started programming, I then realized
                    that I could and would be inventing software all the time. </p>
